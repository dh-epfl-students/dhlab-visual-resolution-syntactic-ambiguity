The sentence contains the word \"enranged\", which is likely to be a typo or a mistake. The correct word is probably \"enraged\", meaning angry or furious.\n2. The word \"enraged\" can have multiple meanings, depending on the context. In this sentence, it could mean that the cow was angry and therefore attacked the farmer, or it could mean that the cow was enraged in the sense that it was driven by a strong emotion, such as rage or fury.\n3. The ambiguity arises because the word \"enraged\" has multiple possible meanings, which can lead to different interpretations of the sentence. This is a classic example of lexical ambiguity, where a single word has multiple possible meanings.\n\nIn contrast, the other types of ambiguity (syntactic, scopal, elliptical, collective/distributive, implicative, presuppositional, idiomatic, coreferential, generic/non-generic, and type/token) do not appear to be present in this sentence. There is no ambiguity in the sentence structure, scope of operators, ellipsis, or references to individuals or groups. The sentence does not imply something that isn't explicitly stated, and there is no unclear background assumption or presupposition. The phrase \"injured a farmer with an ax\" is not ambiguous, and the sentence does not contain idioms or refer to specific instances or categories.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the sentence \"An enranged cow injured a farmer with an ax\" is an example of lexical ambiguity, specifically due to the multiple possible meanings of the word \"enraged\"."

However, \"sightread\" can also be interpreted as \"to read with one's eyes,\" which is a more general meaning of the word.\n2. The context of the sentence does not disambiguate the meaning of \"sightread.\" The phrase \"with a lot of F naturals\" suggests that the speaker is referring to a musical piece, which supports the musical meaning of \"sightread.\" However, the phrase does not eliminate the possibility that \"sightread\" is used in its more general sense.\n3. The sentence does not contain any other words that would disambiguate the meaning of \"sightread.\" There are no other words that would strongly suggest the musical meaning of \"sightread\" over the general meaning.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the sentence exhibits **Lexical Ambiguity**, as the word \"sightread\" has multiple possible meanings and the context does not disambiguate the meaning."

The sentence contains a conditional clause \"Even though he was failing\" that sets a context for the main clause \"he refused to give up\".\n2. The main clause \"he refused to give up\" can be interpreted in two ways:\n\t* \"he refused to give up\" means that he refused to abandon his efforts or goals, even though he was failing. In this interpretation, the scope of the negation \"refused\" is over the verb \"give up\", implying that he was not willing to give up his efforts.\n\t* Alternatively, \"he refused to give up\" could mean that he refused to surrender or admit defeat, even though he was failing. In this interpretation, the scope of the negation \"refused\" is over the verb \"give up\" in the sense of surrendering or admitting defeat, implying that he was not willing to surrender or admit defeat.\n3. The ambiguity arises because the scope of the negation \"refused\" is not explicitly specified, leaving room for interpretation. This is a classic example of scopal ambiguity, where the scope of an operator (in this case, the negation \"refused\") can vary, leading to different interpretations of the sentence.\n\nIn conclusion, the sentence \"Even though he was failing, he refused to give up\" exhibits scopal ambiguity, as the scope of the negation \"refused\" is unclear, allowing for two different interpretations of the sentence."

The phrase \"sometime this year\" provides a time frame for finishing the book, but it doesn't specify which book is being referred to. This ambiguity arises because the speaker might be referring to a specific book they started reading earlier, or they might be referring to any book they want to read within the given time frame.\n3. The sentence structure doesn't provide clear clues to disambiguate the meaning.

The ambiguity lies in the speaker's intention and the scope of the book. Are they referring to a specific book they started reading, or are they referring to any book they want to read within the given time frame?\n\nThis ambiguity type is **Generic/Non-Generic Ambiguity** because the sentence can be interpreted as referring to a general category (type: \"books\") or a specific instance (token: \"the book\").
