The ambiguity lies in the phrase “based on.” This phrase can have two different interpretations:

	1.	Interpretation 1: “Based on” refers to the assertion itself, meaning that the assertion that the theory is flawed is what is based on a misunderstanding of the evidence. In this case, the misunderstanding is about the evidence, which then leads to the flawed assertion.
	2.	Interpretation 2: “Based on” could imply that the theory itself is flawed because the theory is based on a misunderstanding of the evidence.

The ambiguity arises because the phrase “based on” could refer to either the act of asserting (the assertion is based on a misunderstanding) or the foundation of the theory (the theory is based on a misunderstanding). Therefore, the correct classification is lexical ambiguity because the ambiguity centers around the meaning and reference of the phrase “based on.”"

Here’s why:

The ambiguity lies in how we interpret “children who were read to more frequently”:

	1.	Collective Interpretation: The statement could be interpreted collectively, meaning that as a group, children who were read to more frequently had better reading comprehension skills.
	2.	Distributive Interpretation: Alternatively, it could be interpreted distributively, meaning that within the group of children, those individual children who were read to more frequently had better reading comprehension skills compared to those who were read to less frequently.

This type of ambiguity arises from whether the sentence is referring to the children as a collective group or to individual children within the group. Therefore, the correct classification is collective/distributive ambiguity."

Here, the statement implies that the water supply will run out due to the ongoing drought conditions unless something changes, such as increased rainfall or reduced water usage. It suggests certainty about the outcome but leaves implicit whether this outcome is preventable or inevitable.

There is a recognized and essential requirement (legally, ethically, or operationally) for the United Nations to have a monitoring system in place.
Such a system is critical for the function or obligation of the United Nations concerning human rights treaties.
