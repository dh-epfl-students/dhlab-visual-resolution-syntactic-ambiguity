  "phi3_category": "The sentence \"Calvin will honor his father and Otto will too\" exhibits **Coreferential Ambiguity**.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The sentence contains two clauses: \"Calvin will honor his father\" and \"Otto will too.\"\n2. The pronoun \"too\" in the second clause is intended to refer back to the action in the first clause.\n3. However, it's unclear whether \"too\" refers to the same action of honoring his father or a different action.\n4. The ambiguity arises because \"too\" could be interpreted as referring to the same action of honoring his father (Calvin will honor his father, and Otto will honor his father too) or a different action (Calvin will honor his father, and Otto will do something else too).\n5. This ambiguity is due to the unclear reference of the pronoun \"too,\" which could refer to either the same action or a different action, making it a case of coreferential ambiguity."

  "phi3_category": "The sentence \"The new hospital is close to the interstate, making it easy for patients to get there.\" exhibits **Scopal Ambiguity**.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The sentence is structurally clear and does not contain any ambiguous words or phrases that could lead to lexical ambiguity.\n2. There is no syntactic ambiguity as the sentence structure is straightforward and does not allow for multiple interpretations.\n3. The sentence contains a potential scopal ambiguity in the phrase \"making it easy for patients to get there.\" The ambiguity arises from the scope of the word \"there.\"\n4. The word \"there\" could refer to the location of the new hospital or the location of the interstate.\n5. If \"there\" refers to the location of the new hospital, it means that the proximity of the hospital to the interstate makes it easy for patients to reach the hospital.\n6. If \"there\" refers to the location of the interstate, it means that the proximity of the interstate to the new hospital makes it easy for patients to reach the interstate.\n7. The ambiguity lies in the scope of the word \"there,\" which can be interpreted in two different ways, leading to different understandings of the sentence.\n\nTherefore, the sentence exhibits scopal ambiguity due to the unclear scope of the word \"there.\""
